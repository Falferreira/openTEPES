Options
----------
A description of the options included in the file ``oT_Data_Option.csv`` follows:

===================  ==================================================================   ====================================================

====================  =============================================================================================================  =========

A time step greater than one hour it is a convenient way to reduce the load levels of the time scope. The moving average of the demand, upward/downward operating reserves, variable generation/consumption/storage and ESS energy inflows/outflows
over the time step load levels is assigned to active load levels (e.g., the mean value of the three hours is associated to the third hour in a trihourly time step).

Period
------

A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_Period.csv`` follows:

==============  ============  =====================
Identifier      Header        Description
==============  ============  =====================
Period          Weight        Weight of each period
==============  ============  =====================

This weight allows the definition of equivalent (representative) years (e.g., year 2030 with a weight of 5 would represent years 2030-2034). Periods are not mathematically connected between them with operation constraints, i.e., no constraints link the operation
at different periods. However, they are linked by the investment decisions, i.e., investments made in a year remain installed for the rest of the years.

Scenario
--------

A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_Scenario.csv`` follows:

==============  ==============  ============  ===========================================  ====
Identifier      Identifier      Header        Description
==============  ==============  ============  ===========================================  ====
Period          Scenario        Probability   Probability of each scenario in each period  p.u.
==============  ==============  ============  ===========================================  ====

For example, the scenarios can be used for obtaining the GEP+SEP+TEP considering hydro energy/water inflows uncertainty represented by means of three scenarios (wet, dry and average), or two VRE scenarios (windy/cloudy and calm/sunny).
The sum of the probabilities of all the scenarios of a period must be 1.

Stage
-----

A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_Stage.csv`` follows:

==============  ============  =====================
Identifier      Header        Description
==============  ============  =====================
Scenario        Weight        Weight of each stage
==============  ============  =====================

This weight allows the definition of equivalent (representative) periods (e.g., one representative week with a weight of 52 or four representative weeks each one with a weight of 13).
Stages are not mathematically connected between them, i.e., no constraints link the operation at different stages. Consequently, the storage type can't exceed the duration of the stage (i.e., if the stage lasts for 168 hours the storage type can only be hourly or daily).

Adequacy reserve margin
-----------------------

A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_ReserveMargin.csv`` follows:

==============  ==============  =============  ==========================================================  ====
Identifier      Identifier      Header         Description
==============  ==============  =============  ==========================================================  ====
Period          Area            ReserveMargin  Minimum adequacy reserve margin for each period and area    p.u.
==============  ==============  =============  ==========================================================  ====

This parameter is only used for system generation expansion, not for the system operation. If no value is introduced for an area, the reserve margin is considered 0.

Maximum CO2 emission
--------------------

A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_Emission.csv`` follows:

==============  ==============  =============  ===========================================================  =====
Identifier      Identifier      Header         Description
==============  ==============  =============  ===========================================================  =====
Period          Area            CO2Emission    Maximum CO2 emission for each period, scenario, and area     MtCO2
==============  ==============  =============  ===========================================================  =====

This parameter is only used for system generation expansion, not for the system operation. If no value is introduced for an area, the CO2 emission limit is considered infinite.

Duration
--------

A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_Duration.csv`` follows:

==========  ===================================================================  ========
Header      Description
==========  ===================================================================  ========
LoadLevel   Load level                                                           datetime
Duration    Duration of the load level. Load levels with duration 0 are ignored  h
Stage       Assignment of the load level to a stage
==========  ===================================================================  ========

It is a simple way to use isolated snapshots or representative days or just the first three months instead of all the hours of a year to simplify the optimization problem. All the load levels must have the same duration.
The duration is not intended to change for the several load levels of an stage. Usually, duration is put as 1 hour or 0 if you want not to use the load levels after some hour of the year. The parameter time step must be used to collapse consecutive load levels into a single one for the optimization problem.

The stage duration as sum of the duration of all the load levels must be larger or equal than the shortest duration of any storage type or any outflows type or any energy type (all given in the generation data) and multiple of it.
Consecutive stages are not connected between them, i.e., no constraints link the operation at different stages. Consequently, the storage type can't exceed the duration of the stage (i.e., if the stage lasts for 168 hours the storage type can only be hourly or daily).
Consequently, the objective function with several stages must be a bit higher than in the case of a single stage.

The initial storage of the ESSs is also fixed at the beginning and end of each stage. For example, the initial storage level is set for the hour 8736 in case of a single stage or for the hours 4368 and 4369
(end of the first stage and beginning of the second stage) in case of two stages, each with 4368 hours.

Electricity demand
------------------

A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_Demand.csv`` follows:

==========  ==============  ==========  ======  ============================================  ==
Identifier  Identifier      Identifier  Header  Description
==========  ==============  ==========  ======  ============================================  ==
Period      Scenario        Load level  Node    Power demand of the node for each load level  MW
==========  ==============  ==========  ======  ============================================  ==

The electricity demand can be negative for the (transmission) nodes where there is (renewable) generation in lower voltage levels. This negative demand is equivalent to generate that power amount in this node.
Internally, all the values below if positive demand (or above if negative demand) 2.5e-5 times the maximum system demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

System inertia
--------------

A description of the data included in the files ``oT_Data_Inertia.csv`` follows:

==========  ==============  ==========  ======  ================================================  ==
Identifier  Identifier      Identifier  Header  Description
==========  ==============  ==========  ======  ================================================  ==
Period      Scenario        Load level  Area    System inertia of the area for each load level    s
==========  ==============  ==========  ======  ================================================  ==

Given that the system inertia depends on the area, it can be sensible to assign an area as a country, for example. The system inertia can be used for imposing a minimum synchronous power and, consequently, force the commitment of at least some rotating units.

Internally, all the values below 2.5e-5 times the maximum system electricity demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

Upward and downward operating reserves
--------------------------------------

A description of the data included in the files ``oT_Data_OperatingReserveUp.csv`` and ``oT_Data_OperatingReserveDown.csv`` follows:

==========  ==============  ==========  ======  ===================================================================  ==
Identifier  Identifier      Identifier  Header  Description
==========  ==============  ==========  ======  ===================================================================  ==
Period      Scenario        Load level  Area    Upward/downward operating reserves of the area for each load level   MW
==========  ==============  ==========  ======  ===================================================================  ==

Given that the operating reserves depend on the area, it can be sensible to assign an area as a country, for example.
These operating reserves must include Automatic Frequency Restoration Reserves (aFRR) and Manual Frequency Restoration Reserves (mFRR) for electricity balancing from ENTSO-E.

Internally, all the values below 2.5e-5 times the maximum system demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

====================  ================================================================================================================================  ===================================

The model allways considers a month of 672 hours, i.e., 4 weeks, not calendar months. The model considers a year of 8736 hours, i.e., 52 weeks, not calendar years.

Daily *storage type* means that the ESS inventory is assessed every time step, for daily storage type it is assessed at the end of every hour, for weekly storage type it is assessed at the end of every day, monthly storage type is assessed at the end of every week, and yearly storage type is assessed at the end of every month.
*Outflows type* represents the interval when the energy extracted from the storage must be satisfied (for daily outflows type at the end of every day, i.e., the sum of the energy consumed must be equal to the sum of outflows for every day).
*Energy type* represents the interval when the minimum or maximum energy to be produced by a unit must be satisfied (for daily energy type at the end of every day, i.e., the sum of the energy generated by the unit must be lower/greater to the sum of max/min energy for every day).
The *storage cycle* is the minimum between the inventory assessment period (defined by the storage type), the outflows period (defined by the outflows type), and the energy period (defined by the energy type) (only if outflows or energy power values have been introduced).
It can be one time step, one day, one week, and one month, but it can't exceed the stage duration. For example, if the stage lasts for 168 hours the storage cycle can only be hourly or daily.
The ESS inventory level at the end of a larger storage cycle is fixed to its initial value, i.e., the inventory of a daily storage type (evaluated on a time step basis) is fixed at the end of the week,
the inventory of weekly storage is fixed at the end of the month, the inventory of monthly storage is fixed at the end of the year, only if the initial inventory lies between the storage limits.

The initial storage of the ESSs is also fixed at the beginning and end of each stage, only if the initial inventory lies between the storage limits. For example, the initial storage level is set for the hour 8736 in case of a single stage or for the hours 4368 and 4369
(end of the first stage and beginning of the second stage) in case of two stages, each with 4368 hours.

A generator with operation cost (sum of the fuel and emission cost, excluding O&M cost) > 0 is considered a non-renewable unit. If the unit has no operation cost and its maximum storage = 0,
it is considered a renewable unit. If its maximum storage is > 0, with or without operation cost, is considered an ESS.

Must-run non-renewable units are always committed, i.e., their commitment decision is equal to 1. All must-run units are forced to produce at least their minimum output.

EFOR is used to reduce the maximum and minimum power of the unit. For hydropower plants it can be used to reduce their maximum power by the water head effect. It does not reduce the maximum charge.

Those generators or ESS with fixed cost > 0 are considered candidate and can be installed or not.

Maximum and minimum storage is considered proportional to the invested capacity for the candidate ESS units if StorageInvestment is activated.

If lower and upper bounds of investment/retirement decisions are very close (with a difference < 1e-3) to 0 or 1 are converted into 0 and 1.

Variable maximum and minimum generation
---------------------------------------

A description of the data included in the files ``oT_Data_VariableMaxGeneration.csv`` and ``oT_Data_VariableMinGeneration.csv`` follows:

==========  ==============  ==========  =========  ============================================================  ==
Identifier  Identifier      Identifier  Header     Description
==========  ==============  ==========  =========  ============================================================  ==
Period      Scenario        Load level  Generator  Maximum (minimum) power generation of the unit by load level  MW
==========  ==============  ==========  =========  ============================================================  ==

This information can be used for considering scheduled outages or weather-dependent operating capacity.

To force a generator to produce 0 a lower value (e.g., 0.1 MW) strictly > 0, but not 0 (in which case the value will be ignored), must be introduced. This is needed to limit the solar production at night, for example.
It can be used also for upper-bounding and/or lower-bounding the output of any generator (e.g., run-of-the-river hydro, wind).

Internally, all the values below 2.5e-5 times the maximum system demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

Variable maximum and minimum consumption
----------------------------------------

A description of the data included in the files ``oT_Data_VariableMaxConsumption.csv`` and ``oT_Data_VariableMinConsumption.csv`` follows:

Period      Scenario        Load level  Generator  Maximum (minimum) power consumption of the unit by load level  MW
==========  ==============  ==========  =========  =============================================================  ==

To force a ESS to consume 0 a lower value (e.g., 0.1 MW) strictly > 0, but not 0 (in which case the value will be ignored), must be introduced.
It can be used also for upper-bounding and/or lower-bounding the consumption of any ESS (e.g., pumped-hydro storage, battery).

Internally, all the values below 2.5e-5 times the maximum system demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

Variable fuel cost
------------------

==========  ==============  ==========  =========  =============================  ======

All the generators must be defined as columns of these files.

Internally, all the values below 1e-4 will be converted into 0 by the model.

Fuel cost affects the linear and constant terms of the heat rate, expressed in Mcal/MWh and Mcal/h respectively.

Variable emission cost

All the generators must be defined as columns of these files.

Internally, all the values below 1e-4 will be converted into 0 by the model.

Energy inflows
--------------

A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_EnergyInflows.csv`` follows:

==========  ==============  ==========  =========  =============================  =====

Period      Scenario        Load level  Generator  Energy inflows by load level   MWh/h
==========  ==============  ==========  =========  =============================  =====

All the generators must be defined as columns of these files.

If you have daily energy inflows data just input the daily amount at the first hour of every day if the ESS have daily or weekly storage capacity.

Internally, all the values below 2.5e-5 times the maximum system demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

Energy inflows are considered proportional to the invested capacity for the candidate ESS units if StorageInvestment is activated.

Energy outflows
---------------

A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_EnergyOutflows.csv`` follows:

==========  ==============  ==========  =========  =============================  =====
Identifier  Identifier      Identifier  Header     Description
==========  ==============  ==========  =========  =============================  =====
Period      Scenario        Load level  Generator  Energy outflows by load level  MWh/h
==========  ==============  ==========  =========  =============================  =====

All the generators must be defined as columns of these files.

These energy outflows can be used to represent the energy extracted from an ESS to produce H2 from electrolyzers, to move EV or as hydro outflows for irrigation.
The use of these outflows is incompatible with the charge of the ESS within the same time step (as the discharge of a battery is incompatible with the charge in the same hour).

If you have daily/weekly/monthly/yearly outflows data, you can just input the daily/weekly/monthly/yearly amount at the first hour of every day/week/month/year.

Internally, all the values below 2.5e-5 times the maximum system demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

Variable maximum and minimum storage

Period      Scenario        Load level  Generator  Maximum (minimum) storage of the ESS by load level    GWh
==========  ==============  ==========  =========  ====================================================  ===

All the generators must be defined as columns of these files.

For example, these data can be used for defining the operating guide (rule) curves for the ESS.

Variable maximum and minimum energy
-----------------------------------

Depending on the voltage lines are plotted with different colors (orange < 200 kV, 200 < green < 350 kV, 350 < red < 500 kV, 500 < orange < 700 kV, blue > 700 kV).

If there is no data for TTCBck, i.e., TTCBck is left empty or is equal to 0, it is substituted by the TTC in the code. Internally, all the TTC and TTCBck values below 2.5e-5 times the maximum system demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

Reactance can take a negative value as a result of the approximation of three-winding transformers. No Kirchhoff's second law disjunctive constraint is formulated for a circuit with negative reactance.

Those lines with fixed cost > 0 are considered candidate and can be installed or not.

If lower and upper bounds of investment decisions are very close (with a difference < 1e-3) to 0 or 1 are converted into 0 and 1.

The model allways considers a month of 672 hours, i.e., 4 weeks, not calendar months. The model considers a year of 8736 hours, i.e., 52 weeks, not calendar years.

Daily *storage type* means that the ESS inventory is assessed every time step, for weekly storage type it is assessed at the end of every day, monthly storage type is assessed at the end of every week, and yearly storage type is assessed at the end of every month.
*Outflows type* represents the interval when the water extracted from the reservoir must be satisfied (for daily outflows type at the end of every day, i.e., the sum of the water consumed must be equal to the sum of water outflows for every day).
The *storage cycle* is the minimum between the inventory assessment period (defined by the storage type), the outflows period (defined by the outflows type), and the energy period (defined by the energy type) (only if outflows or energy power values have been introduced).
It can be one time step, one day, one week, and one month, but it can't exceed the stage duration. For example, if the stage lasts for 168 hours the storage cycle can only be hourly or daily.
The reservoir volume level at the end of a larger storage cycle is fixed to its initial value, i.e., the volume of a daily storage type (evaluated on a time step basis) is fixed at the end of the week,
the volume of weekly storage is fixed at the end of the month, the volume of monthly storage is fixed at the end of the year, only if the initial inventory lies between the storage limits.

The initial reservoir volume is also fixed at the beginning and end of each stage, only if the initial volume lies between the reservoir storage limits. For example, the initial volume is set for the hour 8736 in case of a single stage or for the hours 4368 and 4369
(end of the first stage and beginning of the second stage) in case of two stages, each with 4368 hours.
